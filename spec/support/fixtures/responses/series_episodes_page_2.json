Along the way, they hear of a trainer named A.J.-a fierce-Pokémon-trainer who has never lost a match. Full of self-confidence from his own record of ten victories in a row, Ash heads directly for the gym to find his new opponent. When they arrive, a huge bulletin in front of the gym announcing, \"This Gym Not Authorized by the Pokémon League\" along with a neon sign declaring \"98 Consecutive Victories\" appeal to Ash's over-confidence. A.J. is on the brink of achieving his goal of 100 straight victories, after which he will embark on a journey to gather badges. Will victory fall on the side of Ash and his 10 straight victories or with A.J. and his string of 98? In the process, will Ash learn some important lessons about the bonds between Pokémon and trainer?"

This tip, Jessie reasons, will lead to heightened security, which will in turn lead to overconfidence and carelessness, effectually making it easier for Jessie and James to sneak in and claim their prize. With Ash already in strong position, Misty accidentally deploys Psyduck to face his Kingler. In a surprise turn, however, Psyduck launches a Confuse attack that wins the match for Misty. Ash takes his place in the stands and cheers for Misty as she begins her next round. Meanwhile Team Rocket watches in shock as-contrary to Jessie's plan-not only is the police presence at the event fortified, but the police show no sign of growing overconfident.\\\r\\\n"
